# Prof-Demo-Practice
Practice Questions for PSU Proficiency Demos


This repo is intended to help students practice for the PSU proficiency demos for CS163 / CS202.

There are files for each of the different structures that will be covered in the demos and each of these files
there will be practice questions that give the description of the question followed by the prototype.

Each Directory contains a makefile for the directory, with the following options:

make
    will compile the questions.cpp, main.cpp, suplied.o

make clean
    will compile the setup.cpp, run the resulting a.out which will wipe the questions.cpp and then remove the resulting a.out

make run
    will compile the appropriate files and then run the resulting a.out if there are no errors.
