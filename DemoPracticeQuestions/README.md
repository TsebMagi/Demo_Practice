Is set of folders is designed to give studens lots of 
problems to practice in order to prep for the Proficiency
Demos

The LLL and BST folders contains sub folders based for the
appropriate classes, each other folder is for CS 202.

Each class folder has a questions.txt file with questions.
The format of the questions is:
Q: <The question that you are given>
D: <The dificulty of that question>
P: <The prototype you will use for the question>

For 202 questions the Prototype you are given is the private prototype
so you will need to add an appropriate public prototype.

You are allowed and encouraged to create helper functions to solve these problems.
