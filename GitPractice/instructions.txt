git init <enter>
git add .
git commit -m “initial commit”
Add some comments to your main.
git status
git add <file name>
git commit
<enter a commit message into the resulting screen that appears>
git log 
Add another set of comments to your main
git add <filename> 
git commit
git log
look for the first set of comments you added.
git revert <the hash you just found>
Resolve any needed modification from the revert
git log
open main and see how your code has changed.
git log
find the commit hash of your initial commit
git reset <initial commit hash> --hard
look at your main

You should now have a main that is missing all the comments. This is 
because we just removed all the commits that had been made since the 
initial commit if we had not used the  --hard flag then the local 
files wouldn't have been changed but the commits would have been 
removed from the log.
