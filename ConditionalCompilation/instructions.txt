This exercise examins the use of conditional compilation.
Main contains a list that is will be adding and removing from.
When examining results keep in mind that the list is sorted, so 
even if items are added in reverse order the resulting list will 
be in order.


1. Examing the main.cpp and makefile files
2. Run 'make test1'
3. Run './a.out'
4. What happened?
5. Can you think of why that might have happened?
6. Run 'make test2'
7. Run './a.out'
8. What happened?
9. Why do you think that happened?

10. Try adding a new conditional flag so that the 
display call at the bottom of main only gets called when that flag 
is flipped on.
11. #define the flag you just created at the top of main.
12. run 'make'
13. run './a.out'
14. Try moving the #define you just put in main into the make file
as a new part of each recipe.
