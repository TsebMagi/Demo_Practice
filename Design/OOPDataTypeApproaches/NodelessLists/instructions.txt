This exercise examines a different structure for data structures.
Main contains a list that we will be adding and removing from.
When examining results keep in mind that the list is sorted, so 
even if items are added in reverse order the resulting list will 
be in order.


1. Examing the .cpp and .h files
2. Compile and run the code.
3. Plan how you would add search functionality to the List class
hint: You may need to update more than just the list class.
4. Add a search funtion and add test cases to main.
5. Test your code and make any appropriate updates.

6. Plan how you would add a remove last function to the list class.
7. Implement the remove last and add testing cases to main.
8. Test your code and make any appropriate updates.
